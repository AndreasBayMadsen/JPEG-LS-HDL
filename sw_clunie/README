This is a preliminary implementation of the proposed JPEG-LS standard,
DIS 14495. See "http://www.jpeg.org/public/jpegnew.htm" for the text of
the committee draft of this standard (which has since been updated, but
electronic versions are not allowed to be distributed due to ISO rules).

Limitations.

The fully lossless mode has been more extensively tested than the
near lossless mode, though the latter appears to work.

The compressed datastream is now interchangable with the HP LOCO 0.90
implementation from their web page. See "http://www.hpl.hp.com/loco/".

It only handles one component (ie. grayscale images) for now.

Usage.

See the man page (in "man/man1/rawnjl2.1", e.g., "man -M ./man rawnjl2").

Installation

1. Edit the Makefile if necessary

2. make World (cleans, compiles and tests)

Miscellaneous.

This experiment is actual part of a larger package, the dicom3tools package
for medical images, which is why all sorts of wierd template generate source
files are needed for the compilation.

The tool reads and writes only raw binary files; if you need to use pixel
data from ordinary image formats, use the netpbm tools to create raw files
(noting the rows, columns and bit depoths to supply to the tool; if you
need to use DICOM files, you can use my dicom3tools package.
