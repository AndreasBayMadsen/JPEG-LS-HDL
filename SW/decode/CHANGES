981012	rawnjl2.cc: fix transposition of Ra,Rb in codecRunEndSample() arg
	list; fix == rather than = for 0 case of Errval while decompressing
	in codecRunEndSample() - bitstream is now interoperable with HP
	code

981011	rawnjl2.cc: add support for reading/writing JPEG marker segments as
	well as zero bit stuffing after 0xff; also added more command line
	options to control defaults, near lossless mode, and ability to turn
	off runs for experimentation.
